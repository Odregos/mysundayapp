phonegap-my sunday app
===================

my first try at using demo app as reference

The plugin is already configured in ```config.xml```

```xml
    <preference name="android-build-tool" value="gradle" /> 
    <gap:plugin name="cordova-plugin-admobpro" source="npm" />
```

Just fork, and add it to your phonegap build apps, then build for ios, android, and windows phone.
